  <title>Authoring Tools</title>
  <para>The Publican Toolchain is a set of  utilities that work in concert to validate, and publish XML to various output formats.  Publican is used by Red Hat&apos;s  Engineering Content Services division as the de-facto standard for producing product documentation according to brand, and translation, requirements.</para>
  <para>For a complete guide to Publican, including installation instructions and commands, visit the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/publican/">Publican home page on fedorapeople.com</ulink>. This page contains, among other information, the User Guide for Publican.  The user guide is compatible with  Version 0.39 and above. </para>

    <title>XML Book Components</title>
    <para>Each book should use a standardized structure, to maintain consistency throughout the project.  The structure present as of September 2009 follows the Publican Toolchain directory structure.  <xref linkend="table-Book-Structure"/> describes the mandatory files that must be present, including a description of the file contents, and where the XML file is embedded into the finished user guide. </para>

    <para>To ensure Maven JDocBook can publish the content generated by the Publican Tool chain, additional XML content is required.  Maven JDocBook does not have access to the Publican Tool chain common_content directory. The required XML files must be included as xi:fallback references in the <filename>preface.xml</filename> and <filename>book_info.xml</filename> files.  </para>
    <para>The content is contained within XML files in the fallback_content directory of each user guide repository.   The fallback_content directory contains copies of the XML files located in the <filename>/usr/share/publican/Common_Content</filename> directory.</para>
    <note>
      <title>Fallback Content Accuracy Check</title>
      <para>The front-matter information located in the fallback_content directory of each user guide repository, is not maintained by the Publican Toolchain team, or upgraded when Publican updates are installed.  Therefore, manually verify that the information contained in these files are kept current with the standards present in the latest Publican Tool chain version.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Fallback content is added to each xi:include element that Maven JDocBook does not have access to.  The structure described in the following XML sample is for the <filename>Legal_Notice.xml</filename> information in the <filename>Book_Info.xml</filename> file.</para>
