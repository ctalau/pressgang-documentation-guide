  <title>Prerequisites</title>
  <para>The following prerequisites are necessary for <application>Maven</application> <application>jDocBook</application> and <application>Publican</application> interoperability.  It is assumed that you do not have any of the following components installed, and require some basic configuration instructions--or links to  appropriate resources-- to make the installation process simple.  </para>
  <note>
    <title>jDocBook local installation not required</title>
    <para>If you use  the <filename>pom.xml</filename> file recommended in <xref linkend="appendix-Pom_Dot_XML"/>, <application>Maven jDocBook</application> is called as a dependency at publish time.  A local copy of <application>jDocBook</application> is therefore not required.  </para>
