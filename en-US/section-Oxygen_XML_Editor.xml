  <title>oXygen XML Editor</title>
  <para>The <application>&lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor</application> is a multi-platform XML editor, debugger, and profiler that supports Unicode.  Because <application>&lt;oXygen/&gt;</application> is a java application, you can use it on any system that support Java.  If your project uses Eclipse, there is a plug-in available that allows you to run <application>&lt;oXygen/&gt;</application>  as part of your Eclipse infrastructure.</para>
  <para><application>&lt;oXygen/&gt;</application> is aware of xi:include statements, and therefore can follow xi:include statements as part of the validation process.  This is almost a mandatory feature in the authoring program you choose, because xi:includes are used extensively throughout JBoss documentation. </para>
  <para>If you prefer to edit in text mode, or prefer full WYSIWYG mode, <application>&lt;oXygen/&gt;</application> offers modes that may suit your requirements.</para>
  <para>Unlike Serna Free, <application>&lt;oXygen/&gt;</application> is not free, nor is it open-source.   Trial versions are available, so consider it along with the other available authoring tools.  </para>
