  <title>Book Structure</title>
  <para>The structure of each user guide in the Mobicents User Documentation Suite (UDS) is controlled by the DocBook XML Document Type Definition (DTD).  Before  updating any user guide in the GCode SVN, it is very important to understand the way each user guide is constructed, and have a good understanding of the DocBook XML standard.  </para>
  <para>The content is contained within XML files in the fallback_content directory of each user guide repository.   The fallback_content directory contains copies of the XML files located in the <filename>/usr/share/publican/Common_Content</filename> directory.</para>
  <note>
    <title>Fallback Content Accuracy Check</title>
    <para>The front-matter information located in the fallback_content directory of each user guide repository, is not maintained by the Publican Tool chain Team, or upgraded when Publican updates are installed.  Therefore, manually verify that the information contained in these files are kept current with the standards present in the latest Publican Tool chain version.</para>
  </note>
  <para>Fallback content is added to each xi:include element that Maven JDocBook does not have access to.  The structure described in the following XML sample is for the <filename>Legal_Notice.xml</filename> information in the <filename>Book_Info.xml</filename> file.</para>
  <para>The xi:include element can have any number of xi:fallback elements defined.  However, in the Mobicents UDS only one fallback is required.</para>

    <title>XML Book Components</title>
    <para>Each book in the UDS is constructed using a standardized structure, to maintain consistency throughout the project.  The structure present as of September 2009 follows the Publican Toolchain directory structure.  <xref linkend="table-Book-Structure"/> describes the mandatory files that must be present, including a description of the file contents, and where the XML file is embedded into the finished user guide. </para>

    <title>Maven Variables</title>
    <para>Througout the UDS, Maven variables are used to substitute values when Maven builds the documentation.  The values that are substituted into the documentation by Maven include version numbers, installation paths, and product names.  What information is substituted for each variable, largely depends on whether the deliverable is for Mobicents or JBCP.  </para>
