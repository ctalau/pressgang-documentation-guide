  <para>The following information will allow you to configure your documentation project to publish in both <application>Maven</application><application> jDocBook</application> and <application>Publican</application>.  The configuration described in this section is recommended if your community project wants Red Hat Engineering Content Services (ECS) to contribute content enterprise documentation enhancements upstream, including translation and content improvements.  </para>
  <para>The work flow assumes that you are starting from scratch; you need to configure a documentation repository for a new book, and do not have any other cross-compatible repositories in your project. </para>
  <note>
    <title>Sample Project</title>
    <para>If you prefer to take an existing repository and customize it to your requirements, you may wish to review <xref linkend="sp-Sample_Project"/>.  A basic <application>Publican</application> book is provided for you to customize to your requirements.</para>
  </note>
